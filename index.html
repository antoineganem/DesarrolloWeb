        <p>Neural networks are at the core of artificial intelligence (AI), 
            fueling a variety of applications from spotting objects in photos to translating languages. 
            In this article, we’ll dive into what neural networks are, how they work, and why they’re a
             big deal in our technology-driven world today.</p>

        <h3>1.1: What are Neural Networks?</h3>
        <p>Neural networks are a cool blend of biology and computer science, inspired
            by our brain’s setup to tackle complicated computing tasks. Essentially, 
            they’re algorithms designed to spot patterns and make sense of sensory data,
            which lets them do a ton of stuff like recognizing faces, understanding
            spoken words, making predictions, and understanding natural language.
